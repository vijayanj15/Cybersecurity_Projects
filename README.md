# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity projects. This repository contains a collection of tools and scripts I have built to practice and demonstrate my skills in both offensive and defensive security concepts. Each project is self-contained in its own directory, complete with its own detailed documentation.

## üöÄ Projects

Below is a summary of the projects included in this repository.

| Project                                                     | Description                                                                                             | Technologies Used         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **[Hash Cracker](./Hash_Cracker/)** | A command-line tool to crack salted password hashes using a multi-threaded dictionary attack.             | Python, Threading         |
| **[Automated Password Assessor](./Automated_password_security_assessor/)** | A web and CLI tool that assesses password strength and checks if it has been exposed in a data breach via the 'Have I Been Pwned' API. | Python, Streamlit, Requests |
| **[Network Reconnaissance Tool](./Network%20Reconnaissance/)** | An advanced network scanner that performs host discovery, port scanning, service detection, and CVE lookup using the NVD API. | Python, Scapy, nvdlib     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

Across these projects, I have demonstrated a variety of technical skills, including:
* **Python Scripting:** Advanced scripting for automation and tool development.
* **Network Programming:** Using sockets and crafting packets with Scapy for network analysis.
* **API Integration:** Interacting with third-party APIs (NVD, Have I Been Pwned) for data retrieval.
* **Web Application Development:** Building interactive user interfaces with Streamlit.
* **Concurrency:** Implementing multi-threading to improve performance in scanning tasks.
* **Security Principles:** Practical application of concepts like hashing, reconnaissance, and vulnerability assessment.
* **Version Control:** Professional project management using Git and GitHub.
