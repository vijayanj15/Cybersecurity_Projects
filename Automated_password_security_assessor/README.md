# üîê Automated Password Security Assessor

This project is a comprehensive tool built in Python to assess the strength of passwords based on multiple security criteria. It features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit and a command-line version for quick assessments.

The assessor provides a final score, a strength rating, and actionable feedback to help users create more secure passwords.

## ‚ú® Features

The tool evaluates passwords against four key security metrics:

* **Length Analysis:** Scores the password based on its total number of characters, rewarding longer passwords.
* **Character Variety:** Checks for the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* **Common Password Check:** Compares the password against a list of the most common and easily guessable passwords.
* **Data Breach Check:** Securely checks the password against the 'Have I Been Pwned' Pwned Passwords API to see if it has been exposed in a known data breach.

## üöÄ Web Application UI

The project includes an easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.
